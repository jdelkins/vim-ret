This is (going to be) my vision of the perfect file explorer plugin for Vim.
I started using Vim in 1995, when I first started using Linux. I have been
interested in file explorer plugins for Vim since about 1998, when I started
working on [Perlbrws][], which is a Perl-based file browser.  I used to enjoy
hacking in [Perl][]. Over the years I have stopped writing software
professionally, and have limited time to do satiate my personal interest in the
field.  I missed the [Ruby][] craze until now, when I have finally discovered
this interesting language. As my first Ruby project, I thought I would rewrite
and improve upon my my old file browser project.

Other inspriations include [Command-T][] and [LustyExplorer][Lusty].

Just started development. Nothing to see here yet.
